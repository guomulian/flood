# Flood Game

A JavaScript version of the game Flood-It! ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.labpixies.flood), [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flood-it/id476943146)) by LabPixies. Not 100% sure if they were the ones who originally created it, but theirs is the first version I encountered, in any case.
